This is a fairly incomplete ansible playbook for managing current VyOS.

It covers most of the more mundane tasks.  Firewalling and NAT in particular was a huge one for me:

* Firewalling
* NAT
* Basic system settings
* Basic interfaces
* Basic services like DHCP, SSH, SNMP

It's obviously missing a ton of stuff, but I ran out of time on it for now:

* BGP/OSPF/etc
* Other interface types
* VPNs
* and much more
